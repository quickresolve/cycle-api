                desc: "Did you know that nearly the entire San Francisco bay front is manmade? Beneath your feet lie abandoned ships, excavated hilltops, rotting piers and nibble dumped into the bay after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Above, you will find one of the world's most inviting urban waterfronts. Beginning at iconic Fort Point under the Golden Gate Bridge, follow Marine Drive southeast along the water, passing the Warming Hut. A natural-surface trail hugs the shoreline through Crissy Field along restored wetlands and sand dunes. A paved path is available inland of the marsh along Mason Street. At the yacht harbor, follow the paved trail to the east and proceed as it meanders along the shoreline through Marina Green, or take the spur trail to the east and see if the eclectic wave organ will play for you. Climb the hill into historic Fort Mason, back down to equally historic Aquatic Park, and continue along the shoreline to Fisherman's Wharf. A gap in the Bay Trail at Fisherman's Wharf means there are no bicycle lanes between Hyde and Powell streets. Head east past Pier 39, follow The Embarcadero promenade along the shoreline and stop at Pier 7 for views of the San Francisco—Oakland Bay Bridge, Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island. Pass the magnificent Ferry Building, take a trot out to the end of Pier 14, and continue south under the Bay Bridge. The path curves along the edge of South Beach Harbor and follows the shore- line around AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Watch an inning for free from the stadium’s public viewing area. The northern bay front, as well as the city's ocean shoreline, is almost entirely with- in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the first urban national park in the U.S. See card #11 for Treasure and Yerba Buena islands. Side Trip: Bike into Sausalito over the Golden Gate Bridge, see the sights, and then take the ferry back to Pier 41 in San Francisco. To access the Fort Baker Bay Trail from the east sidewalk of the bridge, use the stairs from the Vista Point parking lot and cross under the span.",

                desc: "After taking in a free inning of major league baseball at AT&T Park, take the Lefty O'Doul bridge across the China Basin Channel onto Terry Francois Boulevard. Bike lanes and sidewalks are punctuated by small stretches of separated shoreline trails at the Bayview Yacht Club and Agua Vista Park. Stop for a bite or a beverage at The Ramp restaurant, or take in the beauty of the industrial working waterfront from the adjacent pocket park. Head south on Illinois Street bike lanes or sidewalks, cross the lslais Creek Channel and turn southeast on the Cargo Way Bay Trail. Cargo Way ends at Heron's Head Park, so named for its shape when seen from the air. This odd bit of land jutting into the water was created when an additional bridge crossing the Bay was being hastily planned in the 1960's. Today it is a welcome bit of wild in the middle of the City. Before heading to the tip of the heron's beak or continuing around to India Basin Shoreline Park, be sure to stop at the Eco Center San Francisco's only 100% off-the-grid building. Moving south, the long-shuttered Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard awaits redevelopment.  Once complete (in 2029— maybe), the Shipyard will feature mixed-use development, new neighborhoods and open space, and over  4 miles of new shoreline Bay Trail. Candlestick Point State Recreation Area is California's first urban state park and features two miles of mostly paved shoreline Bay Trail meandering through this oasis in the midst of the city. Until trails at Hunter's Point Shipyard are complete, use local streets to reach Yosemite Slough and Candlestick Point State Recreation Area.",

                desc: "To find a hidden gem of shoreline spur trail at Strawberry Point, take Harbor Point Drive off of Strawberry Drive through an apartment complex. Strawberry Drive turns into Seminary Drive where bike lanes and a dirt sidepath await. Seminary Drive ends at Redwood Highway and yet another gap in the Bay Trail for bikes. For pedestrians, a natural surface path parallels Seminary and Redwood—bikes should remain on the (busy) street. Once on the west side of the freeway, an older narrow asphalt path can be found along the shoreline. Continue towards Bayfront Park on Hamilton Drive. Pedestrians can make a shoreline loop detour by taking Shelter Bay Avenue. Access to Bayfront Park and the Mill Valley Sausalito Path—another fine example of a rail-to-trail conversion-—begins across from the police station. This trail along Bothin Marsh offers a great bird-and-people watching experience. The lycra-clad road-riding set whizzes by while parents teach kids to balance on their bikes, and herons, sandpipers and egrets troll the mudflats for tasty treats. The Tennessee Valley Path is an important connector trail heading west to the Pacific Ocean, Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Bay Area Ridge Trail. The Mill Valley Sausalito Path ends as you enter Sausalito, but bike lanes and sidewalks bring you into a thriving downtown. Heading up toward the Golden Gate Bridge on Alexander Avenue, the bike lanes disappear for a stretch before you turn right on East Road (bike route #5) toward Fort Baker. An active military post from the 1850's to the 1990's, Fort Baker glistens with history. To reach the bridge, follow Conzelman Road under, around, and up to the west parking lot. Depending on the time of day and day of the week, bikes may need to be walked down the stairs and across to the east sidewalk. Side Trip: Take the ferry to San Francisco and ride the Bay Trail from Pier 41 up the San Francisco waterfront, across the Golden Gate Bridge and back into Sausalito. To access Fort Baker from the east sidewalk, Lise the stairs from the Vista Point parking lot and cross under the span.",
